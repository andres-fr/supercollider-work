### DESCRIPTION:
############################################################################
the first phase of the project consists on an algorithm that
intends to achieve a close reconstruction of an original audio signal
by transforming and combining different audio samples, the "materials".
The second phase, once achieved a satisfying result, consists on changing
tweaking and changing the environment, in order to force the algorithm
to compromise a solution for non-existing or non-solvable problems.

In this reconstruction, the original signal must be audible, but also
the materials that lead to it. This degree of compromise may be adjusted.

With transforming and combiningit is meant the following:
   - Time delay of a material (phase shifting)
   - Transposition of a material (spectrum shifting, NOT tape-transposing)
   - Multiplication by a constant (normalization)
   - Addition of different materials (superposition)
In notation, this "linear" operation: k*S[t+a] + l*Z[t+b] involves every 
transformation except transposition. In it, k and l are real-numbered 
constants, a and b are time delays, S and Z signals.


***QUESTION: CAN THIS BE FORMULED AS A LINEAR PROBLEM ALSO WITH TRANSPOSITION??
   FOURIER TRANSFORM?
   probably the best approach is to regard transpositions as "new materials",
   that is, a pool of 5 materials with 10 transpositions each is equivalent
   as a pool with 50 materials. But this can be very inefficient(see further).



############################################################################
### OPTIMIZATION OBJECTIVE
############################################################################
3) In order to measure the similarity between two signals, the
   CROSS-CORRELATION is chosen. This operation is defined on the time
   domain, but has a more efficient implementation on the frequency domain.
   ... math (definition, properties, asymptotic)...
   The CC is the "ideal way to find the position of a certain signal mixed
   with white noise". Of course, in our setup there is no "noise", and the
   original signal is very unlikely to contain the materials. BUT the maximum
   of the CC between the original signal and a material returns anyway the
   timepoint where the sample could fit "best". In its mathematical
   formulation, the problem looks like this:

given:
  -> an original signal S[t]
  -> a set of material signals M := {m1[t], ...}
  -> the signal transformation f(t, mat_id, del, trans, norm)

find the (f1, ...f_k) tuple with the corresponding parameters
that maximize the the following cross-correlation:
  -> CC(S[t], (f1+f2+ ...))



############################################################################
### HOW DOES THE OPTIMIZATION OBJECTIVE FULFILL THE GOALS
############################################################################
4) As seen, taking the maximum of the CC over every material leads
to a solution for the {del, norm} parameters. But, there are
still three free parameters {mat_id, k, trans}:
  -> mat_id: which material to take from M?
  -> k: how many material instances should be used in total?
  -> trans: how to choose the transposition?
This three parameters depend heavily on each other, and also on how do
the signals look like. For constrainted types of signals, some assumptions
can be done (for example, if there is a delta in the materials every signal
can be perfectly reconstructed). But since this setup doesn't make assumptions
on the data, this is a NON-CONVEX OPTIMIZATION PROBLEM. What does this mean?
   a) Convex functions have a single, global, minimum (or maximum). And
      Therefore a CLEAR solution, which can be analitically found (usually
      in an efficient way). Non-convex functions have many ups and downs,
      which generate local minima and maxima, and there is no general 
      analytical solution to find the global ones.
   b) This makes the quest for a solution an expensive problem, and on the
      top of that the "solution" is going to be most likely suboptimal (keep
      in mind that "best" fitting doesn't necessarily mean "good" fitting).
   c) But on the other side,this can lead to interesting behaviours:
      the thesis is, that some solutions for the optimization of non-convex
      problems can be regarded as creative, depending on the circumstances.
      The goal of this project is to explore the possibilities of such a
      problematic and gain some experience and knowledge about those
      circumstances and our perception on creativity.



############################################################################
### A FIRST APPROACH TO THE ALGORITHM:
############################################################################

1) Non-convex optimization problems can be solved inefficiently, with some
   brute-force search for instance. This doesn't make much sense when the
   search space is real-numbered, but for small, discrete spaces this is very
   feasable. This is the expected case with the {mat_id} variable: M is
   expected to contain a few number of materials, and therefore a bruteforce
   approach seems feasible:
              next_f = max([CC(S, f(material, ...)) for material in M])
   This list comprehension calculates f for all samples and takes the one
   that returns the biggest CC. Further optimizations, like early termination
   are possible and can be regarded later on.

2) In the case of the {transposition}, the search space for each instance
   is SAMPLE_FREQ/2, wich for a sample rate of 44100 means a total of 22050
   possibilities. In this context, a bruteforce approach would make very little
   sense (for performance reasons), and different optimizations have to be
   undertaken. Some heuristics to try out, from more promising to less:
     -> limit the search space to the regions with most spectral density
     -> limit the global frequency resolution for the transposition
     -> add randomization + early termination

3) Number of instances, {k}: This is de facto the only variable that is
   unlimited. In this case, the strategy is to add materials until some global
   criterium is met, and then stop. Depending on the approach this criterium
   can take two forms:
     -> Stop when the ratio CC(S, (f1+f2+ ...)) / CC(S,S) is higher than a
        certain amount
     -> Stop when the CC(S, (f...)) doesn't get better or gets worse (preferred)


4) So this leaves the following rapid-sketched algorithm, in pseudo-python:

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
S = ... # original_signal
MATERIALS = [...]  # a list with the "material" signals
EPSILON # a small, real number

while not (TERMINATE_CONDITION): # in this case it is the second approach
    # empty at beginning, this list will hold the "best" values for each material
    f_list = [] 
    current_global_cc = CC(S, sum(f_list))
    for mat in MATERIALS:
        # returns a list of desired freqs
        freq_list = heuristic(S, mat)
        for trans in freq_list:
            tmp_sig = f(mat, 0, trans, 1)
            tmp_cc = CC(S, tmp_sig)
            cc_peak = max(tmp_cc)
            cc_peak_index = idx(cc_peak, tmp_cc) # returns the position of the max
            if (cc_peak > TOLERANCE_FACTOR): 
                tmp_norm = normalize(mat, S[cc_peak_index : cc_peak_index+len(mat)])
                f_list.append( f(mat, cc_peak_index, trans, tmp_norm))
    TERMINATE_CONDITION = abs(current_global_cc - CC(S, sum(f_list))) < EPSILON
        
#----------------------------
As already stated, this algorithm repeats until the global CC doesn't progress
anymore. In each iteration, the whole CC is done freq_list*MATERIALS times.
Ignoring the rest of the operations, we have that:

Correlator = O(k*M*freqs)

Which means a cubic amount of cross-correlations. But one caveat: if
"freqs" rises, k is expected to decrease (because a bigger search
space hopefully leads to a faster/better convergence). This shows the
importance and goal of the heuristic(S, mat) function: provide a
"freqs" space as small as possible whilst ensuring a quick and sound
convergence.




############################################################################
### A CLOSER REGARD TO THE PARTS OF THE ALGORITHM:
############################################################################


### CROSS-CORRELATION
The CC itself can be an expensive operation, if not handled with care.
Luckily, it can be very efficiently computated in the frequency domain.
And even more luckily, the transformation between time and frequency domain
can be also efficiently calculated with the help of the FFT algorithm family.
The problem is that FFT constraints the buffer size to a power of 2...
...(further math, see DSP guide)...

### TRANSPOSITION
Once done the FFT of all materials, at the beginning, this is a trivial
task, consisting in shifting on the x-axis and then IFFTing

### NORMALIZATION
Probably taking the standard deviations and dividing is a good way?
check that. Is it efficient??
stddev(S[cc_peak_index : cc_peak_index+len(mat)]) / stddev(mat)


### FREQ. HEURISTIC
As said, the goal of the heuristic(S, mat) function is to provide a "freqs"
space as small as possible whilst ensuring a quick and sound convergence.
Problem: how can heur know that a freq. space will suffice, before
calculating the corresponding f(...) and CC?

see SpecPcile, and such!!

a)
Probably the way to go is the first strategy already mentioned, limit the
search space to the regions with most spectral density IN THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN BOTH SPECTRA (S, sum(f...)). But there are still 2 ways to tackle this:
  -> parametric model: there is a fixed set of inputs, outputs and parameters.
     This means the heuristic looks at the same things, outputs the same
     num of infos (could be exact frequencies, or freq-boundaries...) and
     has a fixed set of parameters (which can be hard-coded, learned...)
  -> non-parametric model: fix a threshold, and take all freqs above,
     or fix a "surface size" and take freqs with a high mean... 
It is also important the fact that natural spectra propagate from low to high
and are therefore not symmetrical.

b)
Something that maybe works is to take the difference of both spectra as a PDF,
and spawn a fixed number of values from it.

### BUILDING/TESTING:
############################################################################

### ENVIRONMENT/TOOLS:
For a first approach, the SuperCollider sound server is going to be used.
It has already many built-in tools, and support for real-time processing.
Firstly, the SCLanguage is going to be used, although a switch to ScalaCollider
is considered and could help enhance the performance in case multithreading
is needed. Everything is also open-source and GPLv3 (which is by the way good).

### TESTING:
The phase 1 is succesful if the algorithm consistently makes a synthesized
signal that closely resembles the original one, while keeping the original
materials noticeable. At first, this can be judged by hearing the results,
but it would be very interesting to capture this "success property" in the
TERMINATE_CONDITION, in order to automatize the quality criteria.
Optimization will be at first ignored, unless really needed.

### ARCHITECTURE:
The algorithm outputs a list of f-functions that can be added in order to
resemble the original signal. This list is incremented as the algo. runs,
following a greedy approach: first are added the materials that contribute
most to the CC, and those are never removed. So it could be meaningful to
have the original signal in one channel, and in the other the resembled 
signal synchronized to it. Then loop both, each time incrementing the number
of f-functions involved. This way can be hopefully heard how the algo. 
behaves through its iterations, and also how does the heuristic and overall
CC perform.

The FFTs of the signal materials can be calculated at init-time, the
CC of the "composed" signal has to be calculated once per while-iteration
Since it is a linear system, simply add the FFTs of the newly added to the
composed FFT.
There is no need to store the FFTs of the transpositions, since by aving
the transp. ratio they can be directly readen from the original

############################################################################
### UPDATE:
############################################################################

1) After a further analysis of the optimization objective, the model changes:

   a) Given a signal S and a sample_set M={m1,m2...} (the materials), resemble
      S as a combination of the materials: S'= sum(f_i(m_i))
      Whereas f(m) = normalization*m[delay]

      Other non-linear transformations, like transposition (and other kinds of
      distortions&filters) are explicitly disregarded, in order to make the
      model more efficient. In order to include them in the model, they are
      incorporated to M, which grows exponentially. For example, if we have 5
      materials, which we want to transpose 10 times each, #M = 5*10 = 50.
      This can grow very fast, but:
           -> it can be set as part of the pre-processing, if needed, so that
              the CPU costs remain low at processing stage.
           -> when working with mono audio, CPU is more problematic than memory,
              especially in live-electronic setups
           -> further heuristics will be implemented, that reduce the search
              space without having big impact in the performance

   b) So the first problem has been "dealt with", through an (still unexisting)
      heuristic, or, in small setups, brute-force. Now, given a FIXED set of
      pre-processed materials M, where each m_i is going to be used exactly once,
      The approximation is defined as:
           S' = sum(k_i*m_i[d_i])
      And the optimization objective as:
           given S and S', find the K€R and D€N vectors,so that
                similarity(S, S')
           is maximal.
      It is VERY IMPORTANT that the signals are preprocessed:
           -> remove DC-offset (crucial)
           -> normalize peak to 1rms (not crucial but desirable for plotting)

   c) But what is "similarity"? The standard way to measure similarity between
      2 signals is the cross-correlation CC (cite DSP). With this, for each m_i,
           max(d_i) = idx(max(CC[S, m_i])
      Note that d_i is ABSOLUTELY INDEPENDENT FROM k_i, that is, for every c€R:
           idx(max(CC[S, m_i]) = idx(max(CC[S, c*m_i])
      Therefore, the D vector can be calculated before the K one. One efficient
      way to calculate CC[a,b] is to do it in the frequency domain:
           CC[a,b] = F'{F[a]*complex_conjugate(F[b])}
      whereas F is the fourier transform and F' the inverse.

   d) It remains to calculate each intensity. For this sake, the criterium of
      minimizing the energy difference will be used. The energy of a signal
      is defined as:

   - Since cross-correlation (CC) fullfills the distributive property (Steven 
     W. Smith, DSP Guide, pages 134 and 139), the following holds:
     CC[S, sum(k_i*m_i[d_i])] = sum(CC[S, k_i*m_i[d_i]])
     So the overall CC can be obtained by adding the separate CCs.
     Recall that the objective is to adapt k, m and d to resemble S as close as
     possible. And since affine transformations (and  therefore additions)
     preserve  convexity of optimizations(convex optimization book, p.36),
     the following holds:
         opt(sum(parameters)) = sum(opt(parameters))
     So it will suffice to optimize each material against S separately, and
     add them at the end.

   - The optimization objective is also not simply max(CC[S, ki*mi[di]),
     because that would hold for every ki->inf. The actual goal is to maximize
     the similarity, which can be divided in two goals:
          a) find the delay for which similarity is maximal:
              d_max = index(max(CC[S, m_i]))
          b) then set the energy of the material to be equal
     
   - Recall that we wanted to reconstruct S by adding different m_i
     signals, each with delay d_i and scaled by k_i:
          a) transposition, and any other non-linear transformations of the
             samples are regarded as a non-linear opt. problem at first, and
             therefore included into the set of materials, M, which will grow
             then exponentially (for example, 5 materials with 10 transpositions
             will yield 50 different materials). With this, the problem formulation
             remains efficient, but the memory space grows inefficiently. The
             heuristic will be responsible of minimizing the size of M without
             affecting much to the result.
          b) given an existing set M, chosen by the "heuristic", the goal
             remains to find the d_i and k_i parameters for each ith material,
             so that 
     so, the problem is reduced to find, for each material, the parameters
         CC[S, (1/w)*m_h[d_max]]
     Whereas:
         a) d_max = idx(max(CC[S, k_max*m_h]))
         b) once given m_h
